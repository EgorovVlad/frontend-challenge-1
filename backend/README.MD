# Backend Project

This README provides quick instructions on how to set up, run, and work with the backend service.

## Running the Project

To run the project in development mode with hot-reloading, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server when you make changes.

## Linting and Formatting

- **Linting**: To lint your TypeScript and JavaScript files and fix issues automatically:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Formatting**: To format your files according to the project's Prettier configuration:

  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```
